# To decrypt and use this data, you *must* first decrypt the .chamber.pem.enc
# file for this Git repository using the "passphrase" you have been given
# securely out-of-band (which was generated by the command sequence
# `chamber secure -f ./exe/settings.yml`). To decrypt the .pem.enc file for use
# with Chamber, run:
#
# $ cp /path/to/{.chamber.pem.enc,.chamber.pem}
# $ ssh-keygen -p -f /path/to/.chamber.pem
#
# Enter the passphrase when prompted and leave the new passphrase blank.
#
# If you want to change the value of the stored API token, set the value for
# `_secure_api_token` to your new desired value and then run `chamber secure` as
# described above. Once secured, this file is safe for committal to a Git public
# repository. **DO NOT** commit `.chamber.pem`, and it's properly paranoid to
# only exchange the putatively-secure `.chamber.pem.enc` file securely. The
# `chamber.pub.pem` file is safe for committal.
#
# As a reminder, to override this value from the command line, run
#
# $ DO_API_TOKEN=your-own-token do_api ...
#
# (or `DO_API_TOKEN=your-own-token bundle exec do_api ...` in developer mode).
# You **MUST** use the explicit environment variable if you do not have the
# `.chamber.pem` file!
